    <h3>~2.0 JUnit~</h3>
    <p>
        JUnit is a widely used unit testing framework for Java. Using JUnit is a good first step in
        testing your software. This section will provide an introduction to creating JUnit test classes in Java.
    </p>
    <h3>~Task 2.1~</h3>
    <p>
        JUnit tests can be used to test methods in a class. An example JUnit test class can be found in
        <code>MyTests.java</code>. You can find details here:
        <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests">JUnit Docs</a>. Everything you would
        ever need to know about JUnit can be found in the JUnit Docs. Note: there are some differences between JUnit 4
        and JUnit 5, but for our purposes it is mostly the same (the <code>@Before</code> annotation differs from the
        JUnit 5 annotations).
    </p>
    <p>
        Tests should be located in a separate package, usually called <code>test</code>.
        The general format you should follow for JUnit test classes in this course is shown in
        <code>MyTests.java</code>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you are testing non-static methods, you will likely need to instantiate some objects. This setup is
            called the test fixture, and can be done using the <code>@Before</code> annotation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>@Test</code> denotes a particular test. Each "@Test" should test a specific case or function. For
            example, if you want to test that a <code>removeDuplicates()</code> method does what it is supposed to,
            you would create a test called <code>testRemoveDuplicates()</code> to test all your test cases. You might
            even be more specific, creating a test method for special cases like
            <code>testRemoveDuplicatesAllElementsIdentical()</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            The success or failure of a test is done using assert statements. There are many types of assert statements
            such as <code>assertEquals()</code>, <code>assertThrows()</code>, etc. They can all be found here:
            <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests">JUnit Docs</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally, if you want to perform some clean up after each test you can use <code>@After</code>.
        </li>
    </ul>
