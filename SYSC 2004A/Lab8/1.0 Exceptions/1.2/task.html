    <h3>~1.0 Exceptions~</h3>
    <p>
        Knowing how to handle exceptions is exceptionally important to writing robust and stable applications. Large
        systems are often riddled with areas where the state, control flow, or the results of an operation are
        uncertain. It is important to anticipate these problem areas and handle them accordingly. This section details
        some fundamentals on Exceptions in Java, and how to handle them.
    </p>
    <h3>~Task 1.2~</h3>
    <p>
        That is a lot of exceptions. Exceptions are not the end of the world, so long as they are handled and do not
        crash your program.
    </p>
    <p>
        Exceptions are usually handled using try-catch-finally blocks. An example of one is presented in
        <code>Main.java</code>.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>try</code>: This is where exception-prone code is placed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>catch</code>: This construct "catches" any exceptions thrown inside the <code>try</code> construct.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>finally</code>: An optional construct.
        </li>
    </ul>
