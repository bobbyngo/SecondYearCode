    <h3>~1.0 Exceptions~</h3>
    <p>
        Knowing how to handle exceptions is exceptionally important for writing robust and stable applications. Large
        systems are often riddled with areas where the state, control flow, or the results of an operation are
        uncertain. It is important to anticipate these problem areas and handle them accordingly. This section details
        some fundamentals on Exceptions in Java, and how to handle them.
    </p>
    <h3>~Task 1.6~</h3>
    <p>
        Exception-free code is always desirable, but the manner in which this is achieved is important. This is to say
        that surrounding your entire application in one big "catchall" block is not good practice. In fact, generally
        try-catch blocks should be avoided where possible. Excessive use of try-catch blocks for all exceptions makes
        for unnecessary code, and can even significantly affect the performance.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Java, the <code>Exception</code> class can be divided into two categories of exceptions:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Checked Exceptions:</strong> These are often called compile-time exceptions because you will not be
        able to compile unless they are handled! This was demonstrated in Task 1.4 with the <code>thrower()</code>
        method. Another example of this type of exception is the <code>IOException</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Unchecked Exceptions:</strong> This category of exceptions are not "checked" for at compile-time.
        Therefore, they can be considered run-time exceptions. In fact, they form the hierarchy of exception classes
        under the <code>RuntimeException</code> class -
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/RuntimeException.html">Oracle Docs: RuntimeException</a>
        . Examples of these types of exceptions are the <code>IndexOutOfBoundsException</code> and
        <code>NullPointerException</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In general, unchecked exceptions should be fixed programmatically. For example, if your method is accessing
        an index outside your List, this should not be handled with a try-catch block, it should be fixed by changing
        the logic or adding some checks. Similarly, a <code>NullPointerException</code> can usually be avoided with a
        single <code>if</code> statement. More on this here:
