    <h3>~1.0 Exceptions~</h3>
    <p>
        Knowing how to handle exceptions is exceptionally important to writing robust and stable applications. Large
        systems are often riddled with areas where the state, control flow, or the results of an operation are
        uncertain. It is important to anticipate these problem areas and handle them accordingly. This section details
        some fundamentals on Exceptions in Java, and how to handle them.
