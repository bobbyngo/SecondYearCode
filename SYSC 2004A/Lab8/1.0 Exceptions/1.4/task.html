    <h3>~1.0 Exceptions~</h3>
    <p>
        Knowing how to handle exceptions is exceptionally important for writing robust and stable applications. Large
        systems are often riddled with areas where the state, control flow, or the results of an operation are
        uncertain. It is important to anticipate these problem areas and handle them accordingly. This section details
        some fundamentals on Exceptions in Java, and how to handle them.
    </p>
    <h3>~Task 1.4~</h3>
    <p>
        This task will introduce two important new keywords in Java: <code>throw</code> and <code>throws</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes we want to "throw" an exception on our own. This is often a custom exception that we have implemented.
        To do this, the <code>throw</code> keyword is used as demonstrated in <code>Main.java</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>throws</code> serves a slightly different purpose. The <code>throws</code> keyword is used to denote a
        method that may throw the specified exception. Specifying exceptions with <code>throws</code> tells the compiler
        that this method must be handled. Meaning, you will not be able to call this method unless you handle the
        associated exception.
