    <h3>~1.0 Exceptions~</h3>
    <p>
        Knowing how to handle exceptions is exceptionally important to writing robust and stable applications. Large
        systems are often riddled with areas where the state, control flow, or the results of an operation are
        uncertain. It is important to anticipate these problem areas and handle them accordingly. This section details
        some fundamentals on Exceptions in Java, and how to handle them.
    </p>
    <h3>~Task 1.1~</h3>
    <p>
        At the risk of sounding redundant, everything in Java is a class, this includes Exceptions.
        <code>Exception</code> is a class from which all other exceptions are derived. It is worth mentioning that
        in Java, there is a difference between <code>Exception</code> and <code>Error</code>. <code>Exception</code>
        and <code>Error</code> are the two subclasses of <code>Throwable</code>. Basically, <code>Exception</code>
        is a not-so-serious problem with the code, and <code>Error</code> is a very-serious problem with the code. We
        can use and handle the former, but the latter should not be handled, and should be fixed outright.
    </p>
    <p>
        See if you can make the code in <code>Main.java</code> throw three different types of exceptions (not errors).
    </p>
    <div class="hint">
        In IntelliJ, you can check what kind of exceptions a method might throw by hovering over it with your mouse, or
        putting your cursor on it and pressing Ctrl + Q.
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        If you call <code>it.set()</code> before <code>it.next()</code> the code will throw an
        <code>IllegalStateException</code>.
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        You can create a <code>NullPointerException</code> by passing <code>null</code> to the method.
    </div>
    <div class="hint">
        If you remove the parameterization of the List argument and ListIterator you will get a
        <code>ClassCastException</code> if you attempt to cast <code>it.next()</code> to a <code>Double</code>.
