    <h1>Lab 8 - Exceptions, Unit Tests</h1>
    <p>Authors: <strong>Martin Klamrowski</strong>, <strong>Cristina Ruiz Martin</strong></p>

        Relevant textbook reading - <strong>Chapter 3</strong> (The Object Oriented Thought Process),

    <h3>~3.0 Lab Problem~</h3>
    <p>
        You must submit your solution to this problem on CuLearn.
        <strong>
            YOU MUST INCLUDE YOUR FULL NAME AND STUDENT NUMBER IN COMMENTS AT THE
            HEAD OF EVERY FILE YOU SUBMIT
        </strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you choose to complete the problem in this environment, the files can be
        retrieved by right-clicking '3.0 Lab Problem'>Show in Files/Explorer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that you have learned how to document code, you need to document your classes for full marks!
        <strong>This is applicable from Lab 4 until the end of the course.</strong>
    </p>
    <h3>~Problem 3.1~</h3>
    <p>
        Submit <strong>PolyTest.java</strong>, <strong>PolyCalcTest.java</strong>
        when you are done.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this problem, you will be revisiting Lab 4 where you created the <code>Poly</code> and <code>PolyCalc</code>
        classes. Completed versions are included for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your task is to complete the test classes. Proper naming conventions and use of
        annotations are required. You must create tests for each required method (you do not need to test
        <code>Poly.printPoly()</code>) in <code>Poly</code> and
        <code>PolyCalc</code> according to the format described in Task 2.1. It may be better to complete this problem
        outside of EduTools.
    </p>
    <p>
        You do not need to cover every possible case with each method. Provide a reasonable number of cases and any
        special cases you can think of. Maybe you will find an error in the code!
