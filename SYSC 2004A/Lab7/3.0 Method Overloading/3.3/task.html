    <h3>~3.0 Method Overloading~</h3>
    <p>
        As mentioned in Lab 6, polymorphism in Java can be achieved by overriding and overloading methods. This section
        will take a close look at method overloading.
    </p>
    <h3>~Task 3.3~</h3>
    <p>
        Method overloading is a way to achieve <strong>compile-time polymorphism</strong> or
        <strong>static binding</strong>.This means method calls are resolved at compile-time by the Java Compiler.
    </p>
    <p>
        Method overloading can be done in any of the following ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Varying the <strong>number</strong> of arguments.
        </li>
        <li>
            Varying the <strong>types</strong> of the arguments.
        </li>
        <li>
            Changing the method <strong>return type</strong> <strong><i>ONLY</i></strong> if one of the above has also
            been done.
        </li>
        <li>
            Unlike method overriding, overloading can be done on methods within the same class, and also superclass
            methods.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Answer the MC question below.

        <strong>Question:</strong> Given the classes included with this task, which of the
        following method signatures are valid method overloads of the method <code>loadUp()</code> implemented in the
        Car class (assuming only the signature under consideration is added at a time)?
