    <h3>~4.0 Generics~</h3>
    <p>
        This section will cover the basics of parameterization, parameterized types, generic types and generics in Java.

    <h3>~Task 4.1~</h3>
    <p>
        Up until now, we have often seen a collection, such as an <code>ArrayList</code>, parameterized with some data
        type upon instantiation, as so: <code>ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</code>. The type parameters are specified using angle
        brackets (<code><></code>), otherwise known as the diamond operator. So what is going on here?
    </p>
    <p>
        If you take a peek at the Java code for ArrayList, LinkedList, you will see they
        are declared with some "type" E. E is a placeholder for a type parameter! With
        <code>public class ArrayList&lt;E&gt; ...</code>, we are saying that the class is generic, and is not expecting
        a specific type; the type is variable! We must then specify the type when we instantiate a new ArrayList:
        <code>new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consider the code in <code>Main.java</code>. Despite what you might think, this code would compile properly!
        This is because the compiler does not know if the type-cast to a <code>FordBronco</code> (line 10) is
        permissible or not, because we have not told it what element type to expect in the List (line 8). Parameterized
        types allow us to keep our generic classes, and also tell the compiler what type to expect so the correct casts
        can be made under the hood, and we don't get unexpected runtime errors. Otherwise known as
        <i>compile-time type safety</i>. Run <code>Main.java</code> as it is now and see what happens.

        <strong>Question:</strong> Given the code in <code>Main.java</code>, what could you change to detect the
        problem with the code? I.e., how can we help the compiler find the problem with the code?
