    <h3>~4.0 Generics~</h3>
    <p>
        This section will cover the basics of parameterization, parameterized types, generic types and generics in Java.
    </p>
    <h3>~Task 4.2~</h3>
    <p>
        As an aside, please note that the information on generics provided in this lab is relatively narrow. There are
        more ways to incorporate generics and parameterization in Java, such as
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/generics/wildcards.html">wildcards</a>, multi-generics,
        bounded generics, and generic methods (<- wow!). These are advanced concepts and should be considered beyond
        the scope of the course. However, you should understand roughly what is happening when you instantiate a
        parameterized type like ArrayList.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are going to write a simple generic class now. The file (<code>Block.java</code>) is provided and started
        for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Complete <code>Block.java</code> such that the errors in <code>Main.java</code> go away, and the correct output
        is produced (you get "Correct" when pressing the Check button).
    </p>
    <p>
        If it is not clear from the code, you need to implement methods (and a constructor) accordingly in the Block
        class. In addition to the shown methods, you need a <code>getHash()</code> method to return the Block's
        <code>hash</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        A brief explanation of some strange things you likely noticed in <code>Main.java</code> and
        <code>Block.java</code>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> : Remember, this is just a placeholder. We can call our parameter type anything. But
            by convention we use one of E, T, K, V. We have seen E in ArrayList, which denotes we have a parameterized
            element type (collection). T denotes an object type. Our class is holding a single object of variable type,
            so we use T.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>&lt;?&gt;</code> : This is a wildcard type! We are saying that we do not know what type to expect.
            Why do we need it? We need it because a Block can hold any type of object, and there is no way for us to
            easily determine what the next Block is parameterized to.
            Note: you will need to use it in your solution to <code>Block.java</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>2004L</code> : If you are curious, this is just a long literal.
        </li>
    </ul>

<!--        <strong>Question:</strong> Given the code in <code>Main.java</code>, what could you change to detect the-->
<!--        problem with the code? I.e., how can we help the compiler find the problem with the code?-->
