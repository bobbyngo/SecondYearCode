    <h1>Lab 7 - Polymorphism</h1>
    <p>Authors: <strong>Martin Klamrowski</strong>, <strong>Cristina Ruiz Martin</strong></p>
    <p>Relevant textbook reading - <strong>Chapter 1, 7</strong> (The Object Oriented Thought Process)</p>
    <h3>~1.0 How Java Works~</h3>
    <p>
        This lab will go over more concepts related to polymorphism, and we will look more closely at concepts already
        introduced in Lab 6.
    </p>
    <p>
        A little background on the Java programming language will help to understand some polymorphism concepts such
        as dynamic and static binding. This section provides a brief overview of the pipeline for a Java program, and
        the sequence of events that takes place after you press 'Run' in IntelliJ.

    <h3>~Task 1.1~</h3>
    <p>
        As we already know, everything in Java is a class, i.e., everything is built from classes. We see these classes
        as lines of code in <code>Main.java</code> for example, but how does "the computer" know how to interpret this
        code and execute it? (Please note that the word interpret is used loosely here.)
    </p>
    <p>
        The first step in the process is the compilation of <code>.java</code> files into bytecode. If you compile and
        run your Java
        programs from a command prompt, you would use a program called <code>javac</code> to first compile your
        <code>.java</code> file. <code>javac</code> is a Java compiler. If you then took a peek into your directory, you
        would find a <code>.class</code> file. This <code>.class</code> file contains the bytecode.

        <strong>Question:</strong> After the <code>.java</code> files are compiled into <code>.class</code> files
        (bytecode), what is the next step?
