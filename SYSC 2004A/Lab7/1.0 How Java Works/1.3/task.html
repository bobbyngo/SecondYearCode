    <h1>Lab 7 - Polymorphism</h1>
    <p>Authors: <strong>Martin Klamrowski</strong>, <strong>Cristina Ruiz Martin</strong></p>
    <p>Relevant textbook reading - <strong>Chapter 1, 7</strong> (The Object Oriented Thought Process)</p>
    <h3>~1.0 How Java Works~</h3>
    <p>
        This lab will go over more concepts related to polymorphism, and we will look more closely at concepts already
        introduced in Lab 6.
    </p>
    <p>
        A little background on the Java programming language will help to understand some polymorphism concepts such
        as dynamic and static binding. This section provides a brief overview of the pipeline for a Java program, and
        the sequence of events that takes place after you press 'Run' in IntelliJ.
    </p>
    <h3>~Task 1.3~</h3>
