    <h1>Lab 7 - Polymorphism</h1>
    <p>Authors: <strong>Martin Klamrowski</strong>, <strong>Cristina Ruiz Martin</strong></p>
    <p>Relevant textbook reading - <strong>Chapter 1, 7</strong> (The Object Oriented Thought Process)</p>
    <h3>~1.0 How Java Works~</h3>
    <p>
        This lab will go over more concepts related to polymorphism, and we will look more closely at concepts already
        introduced in Lab 6.
    </p>
    <p>
        A little background on the Java programming language will help to understand some polymorphism concepts such
        as dynamic and static binding. This section provides a brief overview of the pipeline for a Java program, and
        the sequence of events that takes place after you press 'Run' in IntelliJ.

    <h3>~Task 1.2~</h3>
    <p>
        What is the JVM (Java Virtual Machine)? Well, it is a virtual machine (sort of) that runs Java code. Using a
        virtual machine gives Java the advantage of being portable, meaning any OS can run Java bytecode by adhering
        to the JVM specifications. In short, you can take Java classes compiled on Windows, and run the compiled
        bytecode on Linux (for example), assuming a JVM is present.
    </p>
    <p>
        At a high level, the specifications for a JVM are essentially: must be able to load <code>.class</code> file,
        and then execute it. These functions are performed by the JVM's class loader and execution engine respectively.
