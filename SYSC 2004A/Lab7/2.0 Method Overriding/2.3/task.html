    <h3>~2.0 Method Overriding~</h3>
    <p>
        As mentioned in Lab 6, polymorphism in Java can be achieved by overriding and overloading methods. This section
        will take a close look at method overriding.
    </p>
    <h3>~Task 2.3~</h3>
    <p>
        You may have noticed we have started using the <code>@Override</code> annotation above overridden methods. This
        is not always necessary (depending on the compiler it may be), but in general it is good to add because
        it tells the compiler that the method below is intended to override another method. This is a foolproof way to
        actually ensure that a method is properly overridden.
    </p>
    <p>
        The rules for overriding in Java are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The overriding method must have the same return type (it can also use a subtype of the overridden method's
            return type, called covariant returns).
        </li>
        <li>
            The overriding method must take the same arguments and have the same name.
        </li>
        <li>
            The overriding method cannot use a more restrictive access specifier.
        </li>
        <li>
            Method overriding can only be done by a subclass on methods from superclasses.
        </li>
    </ul>
