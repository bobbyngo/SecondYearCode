    <h3>~2.0 Method Overriding~</h3>
    <p>
        As mentioned in Lab 6, polymorphism in Java can be achieved by overriding and overloading methods. This section
        will take a close look at method overriding.
    </p>
    <h3>~Task 2.1~</h3>
    <p>
        Method overriding is one way to achieve polymorphism. In this task, we have several classes modeling several
        types of cars. As you learned in Lab 6, method overriding enables us to specify different behaviour for classes
        in the same inheritance tree, while using the same method name. The term overriding is intuitive because when
        a method is overridden, you are saying a class should <i>override</i> the behaviour from its parent
        class and replace it with its own.
