            You must submit your solution to this problem on CuLearn.
            <strong>
                YOU MUST INCLUDE YOUR FULL NAME AND STUDENT NUMBER IN COMMENTS AT THE
                HEAD OF EVERY FILE YOU SUBMIT
            </strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Submit <strong><u><i>ONLY</i></u></strong> the files specified at the end of this big red box. The files
            and code within should be completed according to the specifications made <i>throughout</i> the Lab, and only
            the final versions should be submitted. I.e., if Task 55.23 tells you to add accessor methods to MyClass,
            you are required to include that code if MyClass needs to be submitted as part of the solution to the
            Lab Problem (<strong>unless</strong> a later Task or the Lab Problem state otherwise).
        </p>
        <p>
            Do not include redundant methods. Do not include methods that are not asked for or necessary. Some Lab
            Problems will not explicitly state you need accessor methods, but these methods may be necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that you have learned how to document code, you need to document your classes for full marks!
            <strong>This is applicable from Lab 4 until the end of the course.</strong>

    <h3>~Problem 5.1~</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Please note that you are not required to implement your own generic classes for this problem.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        A Car dealership is attempting to shift their business online and automate part of the job normally performed by
        people in their sales department. The project has been dubbed the AutoAutoSalesman.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your task is to create a class called AutoAutoSalesman that will:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Keep track of available <code>Car</code> inventory (classes are provided for you).
        </li>
        <li>
            Make car recommendations based on criteria provided by prospective buyers.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        AutoAutoSalesman must have the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A collection that holds all of the available cars. This collection is passed as the single argument to
            the only constructor.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Auto recommendations can be based on several criteria. The criteria are: <code>pricePoint</code>,
                <code>priceRange</code>, <code>ecoFriendly</code>, <code>style</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any combination of criteria may be selected by the customer, except <code>pricePoint</code> and
                <code>priceRange</code>, <strong>these arguments are always provided together</strong>. For example:
                the customer may
                select the price (<code>pricePoint</code> and <code>priceRange</code>) and <code>style</code> criteria.
                The recommendation algorithm would then make recommendations based on only these criteria. Another
                example: price may be unimportant and the customer only provided <code>ecoFriendly</code>.
            </p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <code>getReco()</code>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This is the method(s) that will return a collection of Cars meeting the criteria specified in the
                    arguments.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cars meeting the provided criteria should be determined as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <code>pricePoint</code>, <code>priceRange</code>: returned Cars must be within
                            +-(priceRange/2) of the pricePoint. For example: a pricePoint and priceRange of 40000 and
                            10000 should yield only Cars priced between 35000 and 45000.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>style</code>: returned Cars must have the same style (String) as the one specified.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>ecoFriendly</code>: returned Cars must have a <code>fuelEconomy</code>
                            below 6.0 (litres/100km) if true. If false no preference should be made.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
