    <h1>Lab 5 - Inheritance</h1>

    <h3>~3.0 Composition~</h3>
    <p>
        Composition is another relationship used to describe how objects interact. Composition is often described as a
        "part-of" or "has-a" relationship. Inheritance, for contrast, is often described as an "is-a" relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have already created a number of composition relationships in previous labs and this one. For example, a
        Virus is composed of Strings, among other things. This is a composition relationship because the various String
        objects exist as fields in any instance of Virus. This means Virus has a dependence on the String class.
