            You must submit your solution to this problem on CuLearn.
            <strong>
                YOU MUST INCLUDE YOUR FULL NAME AND STUDENT NUMBER IN COMMENTS AT THE
                HEAD OF EVERY FILE YOU SUBMIT
            </strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Submit <strong><u><i>ONLY</i></u></strong> the files specified at the end of this big red box. The files
            and code within should be completed according to the specifications made <i>throughout</i> the Lab, and only
            the final versions should be submitted. I.e., if Task 55.23 tells you to add accessor methods to MyClass,
            you are required to include that code if MyClass needs to be submitted as part of the solution to the
            Lab Problem (<strong>unless</strong> a later Task or the Lab Problem state otherwise).
        </p>
        <p>
            Do not include redundant methods. Do not include methods that are not asked for or necessary. Some Lab
            Problems will not explicitly state you need accessor methods, but these methods may be necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that you have learned how to document code, you need to document your classes for full marks!
            <strong>This is applicable from Lab 4 until the end of the course.</strong>

    <h3>~Problem 4.1~</h3>
    <p>
        You will apply the concepts you have learned in this lab. Your task will be to develop two
        new classes (<strong>Person</strong> and <strong>InfectedPerson</strong>), which will interact with the Corona
        class you completed from before.
    </p>

        <li>
            <i>You are not allowed to modify</i> <code>Virus.java</code><i>.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>You will need your completed solution for the Corona class from 2.3.</i>

        </li>
        <li>
            <i>All your classes require complete Javadoc document comments.</i>

    <p>
        <strong>Person</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Person should have fields for: <code>name</code>, <code>age</code> (Integer).
        </li>
        <li>
            There should be accessor and setter methods for all the above fields.
        </li>
        <li>
            Person has two constructors:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    A default constructor which initializes the respective fields to <code>""</code>, <code>0</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An overloaded constructor which takes both fields as parameters and initializes accordingly.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>InfectedPerson</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            InfectedPerson is a subclass of Person.
        </li>
        <li>
            InfectedPerson should have fields for: <code>underlyingConditions</code>, <code>symptoms</code> (both
            ArrayLists), and <code>diagnosis</code> (of type Corona).
        </li>
        <li>
            InfectedPerson should have two constructors:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    A constructor that takes as parameters all the fields specific to InfectedPerson except
                    <code>diagnosis</code>. <code>diagnosis</code> should always be initialized to <code>null</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A second constructor that takes as parameters all the fields specific to InfectedPerson (except
                    <code>diagnosis</code>),
                    <strong>+</strong> <code>name</code> and <code>age</code>.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <i>Remember your calls to</i> <code>super()</code><i>, there should never be an uninitialized field!</i>
        </li>
        <li>
            InfectedPerson needs accessor methods for all its fields.
        </li>
        <li>
            InfectedPerson needs mutator methods for <code>underlyingConditions</code>, <code>symptoms</code>. These
            methods should take String parameters and add the supplied values to the respective ArrayList.
            <br><i>You MUST check for duplicates before adding!</i>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                InfectedPerson has a method called <code>isSymptomatic()</code>. This method takes a Corona object as a
                parameter. An InfectedPerson is said to be symptomatic if they have <strong>at least</strong> 75% of the
                symptoms from the Corona object's <code>symptoms</code> field.
                If the InfectedPerson does have at least 75% of the symptoms the <code>diagnosis</code> is set to
                the Corona object, and a boolean <code>true</code> is returned. Otherwise, just return
                <code>false</code>.
