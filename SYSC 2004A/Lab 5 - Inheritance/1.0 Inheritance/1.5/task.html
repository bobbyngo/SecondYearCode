    <h1>Lab 5 - Inheritance</h1>
    <p>Authors: <strong>Martin Klamrowski</strong>, <strong>Cristina Ruiz Martin</strong></p>
    <p>Relevant textbook reading - <strong>Chapter 7</strong> (The Object Oriented Thought Process)</p>
    <h3>~1.0 Inheritance~</h3>
    <p>
        There is much to discuss when it comes to applying inheritance in your designs. This section will focus on
        inheritance as a concept, and will look at the ways the Java language allows you to apply inheritance in
        practice. It will not provide any recommendations on best practices because there
        is no simple answer, and any revelations provided here would generally be lacking until the introduction of
        interfaces and design patterns. Chapter 7 alludes to these issues briefly. However, you
        can also do a quick search engine query for "<i>is composition better than inheritance</i>" if you are keen on
        immersing yourself in this raging debate.

        This is not to say inheritance is not important to the object oriented programming paradigm. Inheritance is the
        fundamental principal that objects can share common behaviours and attributes, and that these characteristics
        can be passed on by subclassing (inheriting) a superclass (parent class).
    </p>
    <h3>~Task 1.5~</h3>
    <p>
        That confirms it! In summary, a subclass will inherit all of its superclass' members (except constructors).
        However, you may find conflicting information on this, saying that a subclass does not "inherit" private
        members. Just remember, that the superclass' private members are there - they do exist in all instances of
        the subclass. They just cannot be directly accessed outside of the containing class (because they are private!).
        But if the superclass has a public/protected level accessor method for that private field, it can be accessed!
        And so, depending on your definition, a subclass does "inherit" the private members of the superclass.

        <i>Food for thought: Does this violate encapsulation?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        A demonstration of the above explanation is in <code>Main.java</code>; we modify the
        <code>symptoms</code> field of a given Corona object without writing any code in <code>Corona.java</code>.
