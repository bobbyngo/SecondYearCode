    <h1>Lab 5 - Inheritance</h1>
    <p>Authors: <strong>Martin Klamrowski</strong>, <strong>Cristina Ruiz Martin</strong></p>
    <p>Relevant textbook reading - <strong>Chapter 7</strong> (The Object Oriented Thought Process)</p>
    <h3>~1.0 Inheritance~</h3>
    <p>
        There is much to discuss when it comes to applying inheritance in your designs. This section will focus on
        inheritance as a concept, and will look at the ways the Java language allows you to apply inheritance in
        practice. It will not provide any recommendations on best practices because there
        is no simple answer, and any revelations provided here would generally be lacking until the introduction of
        interfaces and design patterns. Chapter 7 alludes to these issues briefly. However, you
        can also do a quick search engine query for "<i>is composition better than inheritance</i>" if you are keen on
        immersing yourself in this raging debate.

        This is not to say inheritance is not important to the object oriented programming paradigm. Inheritance is the
        fundamental principal that objects can share common behaviours and attributes, and that these characteristics
        can be passed on by subclassing (inheriting) a superclass (parent class).

    <h3>~Task 1.4~</h3>
    <p>
        So if a subclass cannot access its superclass' private members, does that mean a Corona object does not have
        any of the fields currently defined in the Virus class?
        Try it out!
    </p>
    <p>
        Given the code for the Corona class below, answer the MC question.
    </p>
    <p>
    <pre>
    public class Corona extends Virus {
        public void myCoronaMethod() {
            System.out.println(family + " " + species);
        }
    }
    </pre>
    </p>

        <strong>Question:</strong> Assuming <code>Corona.java</code> looked as above, would there be an error?
