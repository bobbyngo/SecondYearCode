    <h1>Lab 5 - Inheritance</h1>

    <h3>~1.0 Inheritance~</h3>
    <p>
        There is much to discuss when it comes to applying inheritance in your designs. This section will focus on
        inheritance as a concept, and will look at the ways the Java language allows you to apply inheritance in
        practice. It will not provide any recommendations on best practices because there
        is no simple answer, and any revelations provided here would generally be lacking until the introduction of
        interfaces and design patterns. Chapter 7 alludes to these issues briefly. However, you
        can also do a quick search engine query for "<i>is composition better than inheritance</i>" if you are keen on
        immersing yourself in this raging debate.

        This is not to say inheritance is not important to the object oriented programming paradigm. Inheritance is the
        fundamental principal that objects can share common behaviours and attributes, and that these characteristics
        can be passed on by subclassing (inheriting) a superclass (parent class).

    <h3>~Task 1.2~</h3>
    <p>
        Corona is a subclass of Virus. But what exactly has been inherited by Corona, from the Virus class? Do some
        experimentation in <code>Main.java</code> to figure this out. For example, does a Corona object also have a
        <code>symptoms</code> field? What about methods? Do access specifiers change anything?
