    <h3>~2.0 JCL~</h3>
    <p>
        The Java Class Library contains a plethora of built-in classes and interfaces. We have already seen a number of
        these, such as String, Iterator, ArrayList, arrays, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        This section will serve as an introduction to some popular packages from the JCL.
    </p>
    <h3>~Task 2.3~</h3>
    <p>
        java.lang.StringBuilder is useful when we need to perform a large number of String operations (e.g. many
        subsequent concatenations). Concatenating String objects together is computationally expensive, as under the hood
        a new String is being created for every concatenation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Write code in <code>one.one.Main.java</code> to do the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Continuously take input from console. The loop should quit when the user types in "quit".
        </li>
        <li>
            While taking input, each line should be appended to a StringBuilder object (as a new line).
        </li>
        <li>
            When the user enters quit, print out the StringBuilder (not including "quit").
        </li>
    </ol>

            the left of the main method signature.
