    <h1>Lab 4 - JCL, Packages, Javadoc</h1>

    <h3>~2.0 JCL~</h3>
    <p>
        The Java Class Library contains a plethora of built-in classes and interfaces. We have already seen a number of
        these such as String, Iterator, ArrayList, and arrays.
    </p>
    <p>
        This section will serve as an introduction to some popular packages from the JCL.
    </p>
    <h3>~Task 2.1~</h3>
    <p>
        A very useful class is the Scanner class. Scanner belongs to the util package, which contains some other useful
        classes that we already know. Scanner can be used to read input from the console.
    </p>
    <p>
        Read the docs for Scanner here:
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html">Oracle Docs: Scanner</a>. As you may
        have noticed, many tasks refer you to Oracle Documentation if you are stuck.

            It is important to begin familiarizing yourself with the Java documentation, and learning how to extract the
            information you need from these extensive resources.
        </i>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In <code>one.one.Main.java</code> import the Scanner class so that it can be used. Create a new Scanner in the
            <code>main()</code> method.
            <div class="hint">
                To read from console we need to provide the Scanner constructor with the <code>System.in</code> InputStream:
                <code>new Scanner(System.in)</code>. And that is it! We do not need to worry about the details of how
                this works because it is all abstracted away for us!
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            Go into the Scanner documentation and find a method that we can use to read a single line of text from
            console.
        </li>
        <li>
            Read a single line from console and store it in a variable.
        </li>
        <li>
            Echo the line back to console (print it!).
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <i>
            Note: to be able to type in the terminal you need to run one.one.Main.main() by clicking the small green arrow to
            the left of the main method signature.
