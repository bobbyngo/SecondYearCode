            You must submit your solution to this problem on CuLearn.
            <strong>
                YOU MUST INCLUDE YOUR FULL NAME AND STUDENT NUMBER IN COMMENTS AT THE
                HEAD OF EVERY FILE YOU SUBMIT
            </strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Submit <strong><u><i>ONLY</i></u></strong> the files specified at the end of this big red box. The files
            and code within should be completed according to the specifications made <i>throughout</i> the Lab, and only
            the final versions should be submitted. I.e., if Task 55.23 tells you to add accessor methods to MyClass,
            you are required to include that code if MyClass needs to be submitted as part of the solution to the
            Lab Problem (<strong>unless</strong> a later Task or the Lab Problem state otherwise).
        </p>
        <p>
            Do not include redundant methods. Do not include methods that are not asked for or necessary. Some Lab
            Problems will not explicitly state you need accessor methods, but these methods may be necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that you have learned how to document code, you need to document your classes for full marks!
            <strong>This is applicable from Lab 4 until the end of the course.</strong>

    <h3>~Problem 4.1~</h3>

    <p>
        For this problem you will be making your own package called mymath. This package will have two classes:
        <strong>mymath.Poly</strong> and <strong>mymath.PolyCalc</strong>. Both classes require <strong>complete</strong>
        Javadoc document comments. Also make sure you create the package and add both classes to it.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>mymath.Poly</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                This class will model a polynomial of the form:
                Ax<sup>n-1</sup> + Bx<sup>n-2</sup> ... Ux<sup>3</sup> + Wx<sup>2</sup> + Yx + Z. It has one constructor
                that takes an array of double coefficients of size n (n > 0). I.e., you can assume that only non-empty
                arrays will be passed to the constructor.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, to make the polynomial
                4x<sup>2</sup> + 3x - 2, it should be made this way <code>new mymath.Poly(new double[]{4, 3, -2})</code>.
                The same polynomial could also be made this way <code>new mymath.Poly(new double[]{0, 0, 0, 4, 3, -2})</code>.
                You are free to store these parameters however you choose.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            mymath.Poly has a method called <code>evaluate()</code>. This method will return the double value of the polynomial
            evaluated for a given x (you can tap into
            <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html">java.lang.Math</a>
            for some handy maths operators).
        </li>
        <li>
            mymath.Poly has a method called <code>printPoly()</code>. This method should print the polynomial out in the form mentioned
            above: ax<sup>3</sup> + bx<sup>2</sup> + cx + d. However, terms with 0 coefficients should be
            omitted. For example, the polynomial 5.5x<sup>3</sup> - 3.1x + 3 should be printed as:<br>
            <code>"5.5x^3 - 3.1x^1 + 3.0"</code>. If the mymath.Poly has all 0 coefficients, print an empty String.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can define accessor methods for mymath.Poly and keep track of any other attributes you like.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>mymath.PolyCalc</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This class will contain some calculus we can perform on a mymath.Poly object. You do not need to define a
            constructor. This class will behave as a utility class in the sense that we do not need to create an
            instance of the class to access its members. java.lang.Math is another example of this kind of class. To
            make this possible, we simply need to define a member as <code>static</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            mymath.PolyCalc has a <strong>static</strong> method called <code>differentiate()</code> . This method should
            calculate the coefficients for the derivative of the supplied mymath.Poly object. It should then create a new mymath.Poly
            object from those coefficients and return it. The "new coefficients" array should ALWAYS be the same length
            as the original array. Also, you do not need to round coefficients.
        </li>
        <li>
            mymath.PolyCalc has a <strong>static</strong> method called <code>integrate()</code> . This method should calculate the
            coefficients for the integral of the supplied mymath.Poly object. It should then create a new mymath.Poly object
            from those coefficients and return it. Assume the integration constant C is always 0.
            The "new coefficients" array should ALWAYS be the same length + 1 as the
            original array (integrals go up an order). It does not matter if the original array is [0, 0, 0, 1], the
            new array should then be [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. Also, you do not need to round coefficients.
