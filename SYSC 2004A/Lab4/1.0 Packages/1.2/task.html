    <h3>~1.0 Packages~</h3>
    <p>
        Packages are a way to group related classes together. A number of "built-in" packages have already been used
        such as ArrayList from the util package (java.util.ArrayList), or String (java.lang.String). These are some of
        the packages that make up the JCL (Java Classes Library), which will be discussed in the next section.
        You can think of packages as directories on your computer, that can hold files and other subdirectories.
    </p>
    <p>
        Packages are useful for a number of reasons. Defining a package can prevent class name collisions in large
        applications; you may want to define your own ArrayList class for example, or import one from a third-party.
        Packages are also useful tools for enforcing the OO principle of encapsulation. We can hide details about our
        classes so that they can only be accessed from within the scope of their package.
    </p>
    <p>
        This section looks at how packages can be used to elevate the quality of Java applications.
    </p>
    <h3>~Task 1.2~</h3>
    <p>
        Packages can help achieve encapsulation. As we already know, the most common way to achieve
        encapsulation is through information hiding. The main way we hide information is using access
        specifiers (<code>public</code>, <code>protected</code>, <code>private</code>, <code>&lt;default&gt;</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
        We have a package (one) that contains two classes, A and B. We want to use these classes from our
        <code>main()</code> method.
