    <h3>~1.0 Packages~</h3>
    <p>
        Packages are a way to group related classes together. A number of "built-in" packages have already been used
        such as ArrayList from the util package (java.util.ArrayList), or String (java.lang.String). These are some of
        the packages that make up the JCL (Java Classes Library), which will be discussed in the next section.
        You can think of packages as directories on your computer, that can hold files and other subdirectories.
    </p>
    <p>
        Packages are useful for a number of reasons. Defining a package can prevent class name collisions in large
        applications; you may want to define your own ArrayList class for example, or import one from a third-party.
        Packages are also useful tools for enforcing the OO principle of encapsulation. We can hide details about our
        classes so that they can only be accessed from within the scope of their package.
    </p>
    <p>
        This section looks at how packages can be used to elevate the quality of Java applications.
    </p>
    <h3>~Task 1.1~</h3>
    <p>
        As already mentioned, packages can be conceptualized as a hierarchy of folders and sub-folders. Each folder
        contains a set of closely related classes and interfaces. Take ArrayList for example, it belongs to the
        util package, which in turn belongs to the java package.
    </p>
    <p>
        To specify the package to which a class belongs, we include the following statements at the top (header) of the
        file:<br>
        <code>package packagename;</code>. There are naming conventions for packages, which can be found here:
        <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-namingconventions.html#367">Oracle Docs: Naming Conventions</a>.
        Take a look at them, but do not worry too much about them because this lab is not focused on naming conventions.
    </p>
    <p>
        To use a package and/or the classes it contains, we must import it. Packages/classes required by the current
        class must be imported in the header of the file where they are used. There are <strong>three</strong>
        exceptions to this, i.e. the Java compiler <strong>always</strong> imports the following automatically:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The package of the current class.</li>
        <li>The lang package (contains String, Object, ...).</li>
        <li>
            The default package (any class that was not specified as belonging to a particular package) - also called
            the "package with no name".
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Make the required import in <code>one.one.Main.java</code> to fix the error.
    </p>
