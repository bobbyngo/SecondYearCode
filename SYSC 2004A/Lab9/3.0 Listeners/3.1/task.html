    <h3>~3.0 Listeners~</h3>
    <p>
        Visuals are great, but how do we add some functionality to an application? This is generally implemented using
        listeners. This section provides an introduction on how to use them.
    </p>
    <h3>~Task 3.1~</h3>
    <p>
        The first listener to be aware of is the ActionListener. It is common to attach an ActionListener to a JButton.
        By doing this we can define behaviour that will happen when the JButton is clicked.
    </p>
    <p>
        In <code>Main.java</code> there is a method called <code>getColourButton()</code> which returns a JButton in
        the form we want. You should try to do this for any standard components that appear many times in your
        application. In this way you aren't writing a 3000-line <code>main()</code> or <code>displayGUI()</code> method.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are probably wondering what the code below does. The first line is simple: we are adding a new
        ActionListener object. The next part is the creation of an anonymous inner class. It is called anonymous because
        it is not declared as a class usually is (<code>class MyClass {}</code>), and therefore has no name. Basically,
        what is happening is a subclass of ActionListener is being created, and we are giving this anonymous subclass
        an overriding method for the superclass' method <code>actionPerformed()</code>. <code>actionPerformed()</code>
        is what gets called under the hood when an event occurs (such as a button click).
    </p>
    <p>
        Be careful! Within the context of the anonymous inner class, <code>this</code> no longer refers to the outer
        class!
    </p>
    <pre>
button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
    @Override
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent ae) {
        System.out.println("AHHHH");
    }
});
    </pre>
    <p>
        For this task, you must add a few JButtons to the <code>bodyPanel</code>.
