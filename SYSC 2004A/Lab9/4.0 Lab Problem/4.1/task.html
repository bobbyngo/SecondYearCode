    <h1>Lab 9 - Introduction to Swing GUIs</h1>

    <h3>~4.0 Lab Problem~</h3>
    <div class="preamble">
        <p>
            You must submit your solution to this problem on CuLearn.
            <strong>
                YOU MUST INCLUDE YOUR FULL NAME AND STUDENT NUMBER IN COMMENTS AT THE
                HEAD OF EVERY FILE YOU SUBMIT
            </strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Submit <strong><u><i>ONLY</i></u></strong> the files specified at the end of this big red box. The files
            and code within should be completed according to the specifications made <i>throughout</i> the Lab, and only
            the final versions should be submitted. I.e., if Task 55.23 tells you to add accessor methods to MyClass,
            you are required to include that code if MyClass needs to be submitted as part of the solution to the
            Lab Problem (<strong>unless</strong> a later Task or the Lab Problem state otherwise).
        </p>
        <p>
            Do not include redundant methods. Do not include methods that are not asked for or necessary. Some Lab
            Problems will not explicitly state you need accessor methods, but these methods may be necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that you have learned how to document code, you need to document your classes for full marks!
            <strong>This is applicable from Lab 4 until the end of the course.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you choose to complete the problem in this environment, the files can be
            retrieved by right-clicking '4.0 Lab Problem'>Show in Files/Explorer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Submit <strong>PaletteGenerator.java</strong> when you are done.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h3>~Problem 4.1~</h3>
    <p>
        For this problem, you must build on the code we have already completed. It is provided for you in
        <code>Main.java</code>. YOU MUST gradually move it over into our new class PaletteGenerator. When you
        are done, there should be nothing in <code>Main.java</code> except for the <code>main()</code> method
        containing the following code:
    </p>
    <pre>
PaletteGenerator pg = new PaletteGenerator();
pg.displayGUI();
    </pre>
    <p>
        You will be creating an application that will generate a random set of colours using the
        <code>getColour()</code> method provided.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Your task:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The general layout of the application is already provided. Feel free to move the creation of the various
            components into their own separate <i>private</i> methods. In fact, it is strongly recommended you do.
        </li>
        <li>
            The PaletteGenerator will have three sections:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Header: Contains only a label with a title.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Body: Contains <strong><u>8</u></strong> JPanels with associated lock JButtons that will represent
                    our generated colour palette. Each colour JPanel will have an associated lock button, that when
                    clicked will lock that colour panel so that if the generate button is clicked again, it will not
                    change. A lock button can be unclicked, so if generate is clicked the colour panel will once again
                    change.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Footer: A single JButton that we can click to generate a new palette.
                </li>
            </ol>
            It must look like this (in structure, exact text is not necessary):
            <img src="src/example-palette.png">
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Guidelines:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You cannot:
            <ul>
                <li>Extend JFrame.</li>
                <li>Change the general layout.</li>
                <li>Add more components than asked for.</li>
                <li>Have any more public methods than <code>displayGUI()</code></li>
                <li>Have more or less than 8 colour panels.</li>
                <li>
                    Set the size of your frame; it must be resizeable, and the colour panels must dynamically resize to
                    fill the window.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove the WindowListener provided. A prompt must be displayed before quitting.
                </li>
                <li>Have ANY static members in PaletteGenerator.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            You can:
            <ul>
                <li>Use different layouts (though it is not recommended).</li>
                <li>Nest several JPanels (within reason) with their own layout managers.</li>
                <li>Keep as many private fields (within reason, you do not need many) you want.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
