        In this lab you will be experimenting with Swing components. Swing is a GUI framework used to create visual
        applications in Java. Why Swing? Yes, there are many other such frameworks in Java, but Swing is easy to grasp
        and provides practice on many GUI fundamentals. Not to mention that IntelliJ IDEA is a Swing application.
        If you cannot believe that, look for yourself! -->

    <h3>~Task 1.1~</h3>
    <p>
        Swing is a package, and is usually included, so there is no need to install it. To use Swing, you must simply
        import it as shown in <code>Main.java</code>. Swing GUIs are made out of components. Swing has many types of
        components which can be used by instantiating the associated class. Look here for a quick overview of the
        main components you will likely be using:
        <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/sp14/psets/ps4/java-6-tutorial/components.html">Swing Components</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first component you should become familiar with is the JFrame. A JFrame is a "top-level container". You
        will likely not have a need for the other top-level containers in this course. Being the top-level container,
        you should have only one instance of a JFrame in any given application. As usual, there will be an opposing view
        to this, but for this course, you should take a single JFrame approach in your applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        To run the example in <code>Main.java</code>, be sure to click the little green arrow adjacent
        <code>main()</code> and not 'Run'.
