    <h3>~2.0 Layouts~</h3>
    <p>
        Layouts are the most important part of a Swing application. They determine how your application will look, and
        function. Complete this section to find out about how to manage the placement of components in your application.
    </p>
    <h3>~Task 2.3~</h3>
    <p>
        Let's start experimenting with different layouts. First, we are going to set the background colours for our
        JLabels so that we can more easily see how layouts are arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first step is to add in another important Swing component called a JPanel. A JPanel can be thought of as a
        container. A JPanel uses a layout manager, "holds" multiple other components, and can have its background colour
        set!
    </p>
    <p>
        Checkout the example in <code>Main.java</code>. We have multiple JPanels being made, which are later added to
        the frame.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make the appropriate additions to <code>Main.java</code> to add the JLabels to the frame such that they are
        all visible, adequately spaced out, and have a background colour. Keep in mind that the default layout
        manager for JPanel is the FlowLayout.
