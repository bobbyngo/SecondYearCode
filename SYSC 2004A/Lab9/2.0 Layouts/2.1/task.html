    <h3>~2.0 Layouts~</h3>
    <p>
        Layouts are the most important part of a Swing application. They determine how your application will look, and
        function. Complete this section to find out about how to manage the placement of components in your application.
    </p>
    <h3>~Task 2.1~</h3>
    <p>
        Our example does not look very good so far. The label is off-center and barely visible. How can we change this?
        Using Layouts! Checkout the available layouts here:

    <p>
        The default layout for a JFrame is the BorderLayout. So our frame is using a BorderLayout. Looking at the
        documentation for BorderLayout, we can see the possible positions for components in this layout. To set the
        position of a component when we add it, we must specify it in the call to <code>JFrame.add()</code>. An example
        is shown in <code>Main.java</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Important notes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Notice the call to <code>frame.setSize()</code> is removed. We have replaced it with a call to
            <code>frame.pack()</code> farther down. In general, you should use <code>frame.pack()</code>. What
            <code>frame.pack()</code> does is it "squishes" all the components together and sizes them to their
            preferred size or greater. Where are these preferred sizes determined? Generally, through your layout
            manager! More on this later!
        </li>
        <li>
            The call to <code>frame.setResizeable()</code> has also been removed so we can resize our window.
        </li>
        <li>
            Notice the import of java.awt.*. This is a needed package, but you should not concern yourself too much
            with the details. In brief, Swing is built in part off of AWT. Specifically, the JWindow inheritance tree
            (JFrame, for example).
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> finally we can see why it is a good idea to be explicit in your import
                    statements. Try importing <code>java.awt.*</code> and <code>java.util.*</code>, and then creating
                    a new List. We get a class clash; not good! You will likely run into this issue in the Lab Problem.
                    Be explicit in your imports: it is fine to have many import statements.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Make the appropriate additions to <code>Main.java</code> to add the JLabels to the frame such that they are
        all visible.
