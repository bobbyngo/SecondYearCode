    <h1>Lab 11 - Interfaces and Abstract Classes</h1>
    <p>Authors: <strong>Martin Klamrowski</strong>, <strong>Cristina Ruiz Martin</strong></p>
    <p>Relevant textbook reading - <strong>Chapter 8</strong> (The Object Oriented Thought Process)</p>
    <h3>~4.0 Lab Problem~</h3>
    <div class="preamble">
        <p>
            You must submit your solution to this problem on CuLearn.
            <strong>
                YOU MUST INCLUDE YOUR FULL NAME AND STUDENT NUMBER IN COMMENTS AT THE
                HEAD OF EVERY FILE YOU SUBMIT
            </strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Submit <strong><u><i>ONLY</i></u></strong> the files specified at the end of this big red box. The files
            and code within should be completed according to the specifications made <i>throughout</i> the Lab, and only
            the final versions should be submitted. I.e., if Task 55.23 tells you to add accessor methods to MyClass,
            you are required to include that code if MyClass needs to be submitted as part of the solution to the
            Lab Problem (<strong>unless</strong> a later Task or the Lab Problem state otherwise).
        </p>
        <p>
            Do not include redundant methods. Do not include methods that are not asked for or necessary. Some Lab
            Problems will not explicitly state you need accessor methods, but these methods may be necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that you have learned how to document code, you need to document your classes for full marks!
            <strong>This is applicable from Lab 4 until the end of the course.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you choose to complete the problem in this environment, the files can be
            retrieved by right-clicking '4.0 Lab Problem'>Show in Files/Explorer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Submit <strong>Post.java</strong>, <strong>PostWall.java</strong>, <strong>VideoPost.java</strong>,
            <strong>PollPost.java</strong>, <strong>MessagePost.java</strong> when you are done.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>
                Note: You are not required to submit some of the files included. Assume this means that you are not
                to modify these files. I.e. a TA will run your code with those files in the state they were given to
                you.
            </i>
        </p>
    </div>
    <h3>~Problem 4.1~</h3>
    <p>
        Convert <code>Post</code> into an interface! The code must work exactly the same. Modify any other files
        as appropriate. The other types of Posts will obviously have to implement this new interface.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>
            Note: You are also being marked on the decisions you make when refactoring
        </i> <code>Post.java</code>.
        <i>
            So think carefully about which methods to include in each class/interface.
